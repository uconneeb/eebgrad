I am a fictitious graduate student in the [UConn EEB department](https://eeb.uconn.edu) interested in the evolution, systematics, and ecology of seed and seedless plants, vertebrate and invertebrate animals, fungi, protists, and prokaryotes. I am also interested in developing ecological, phylogenetic, anatomical, and physiological methods.

That photo of me below is a blend of 4 male and 4 female faces from diverse ethnicities using tools on the [faceresearch.org](https://faceresearch.org) web site.
